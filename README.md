## 1 Banana = 1 Banano

Created for the [Booster 2 Hackathon](https://banano.cc/blog/booster2-banano-hackathon)

## The Idea

A web frontend where a user takes a photo of a banana. The photo is then sent to the server, and the server determines if the photo is original (not from the Internet) and not a duplicate. If the photo is original, the server will send a reward to the user.

## Limitations

Google Reverse Image Search was implemented, and it worked great, until Google rate limits you. The only other option is TinEye, and they charge $0.04 per image, which is way too much for this faucet, which already isn't intended to make money. So, unfortunately, the best I can do is take hashes of every image to prevent duplicates.

## Donations

Do ~~not~~ feed the monkeys!
