# banano-scavenger

## is a funny faucet for the funny monkecoin

Created for the [Booster 2 Hackathon](https://banano.cc/blog/booster2-banano-hackathon)

DEADLINE: September 4th, 2022

## The Idea

A web frontend where a user takes a photo of a banana. The photo is then sent to the server, and the server determines if the photo is original (not from the Internet) and not a duplicate. If the photo is original, the server will send a reward to the user.
