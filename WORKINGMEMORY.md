# The ramblings and voices inside my head

## crossed out things are done

Okay, so I guess I'm doing this. First, I need to make sure that I can even ~~detect the banana~~ (hey, that was pretty easy!), so I guess I'll start with Tensorflow.js.

It needs to be ~~a web form that sends the image to the server~~, and ~~the server does the rest~~. (Formidable sure is convenient!)

Then, I'll need to check and make sure the images are original. Reverse image lookup, then ~~perceptual hashing and storing~~ to prevent duplicates and cheaters.

Finally, I need to actually ~~send the banano~~. I guess I'll use [bananojs](https://github.com/BananoCoin/bananojs). (Took more work than it should have, and I'm getting close to async hell.)

I should add a ~~balance indicator~~ and ~~automatic donation receiving~~.

Then I'll make it look nice. It just looks like a template, I should add some images and more text/pages.
