# The ramblings and voices inside my head

Okay, so I guess I'm doing this. First, I need to make sure that I can even detect the banana, so I guess I'll start with Tensorflow.js. DONE! Wow, that wasn't so bad. It's also pretty quick.

It needs to be a web application that sends the image to the server, and the server does the rest. DONE! That part works.

Then, I'll need to check and make sure the images are original. Reverse image lookup, then phashing and storing to prevent duplicates. SEMI-DONE! I still need to reverse image lookup.

Finally, I need to actually send the banano. I guess I'll use [bananojs](https://github.com/BananoCoin/bananojs). DONE! Took more work than it needed, man I hate async right now. I should probably learn how to escape async hell.

Then I'll make it look nice. It just looks like a template, I should add some images and more text/pages.
